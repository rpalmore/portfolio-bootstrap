# Rebecca Palmore: Portfolio

[See it live!](http://www.rebeccapalmore.com/)

## Description

This portfolio started as a homework assignment for [Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp](https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu/). Our week two assignment: build a professional portfolio site using the Bootstrap CSS framework. 

Included in our instructions were a short style guide and screenshots of a layout we had to match. Heroku deployment was also required.

Since completing the homework assignment, I've added functionality to the portfolio, including Express and Nodemailer, and deployed it to my own domain.

I plan to keep this portfolio updated with projects and will continue to tweak its design.
